        "# **Python Theory Questions: Files, Exception Handling, Logging, and Memory Management**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "Interpreted languages (like Python, JavaScript) execute code line by line, making debugging easier but execution slower. Compiled languages (like C, C++) translate the entire code into machine language before execution, making them faster but harder to debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "Exception handling in Python helps manage runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks. This prevents abrupt program termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. What is the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "The `finally` block ensures that certain cleanup operations (like closing a file or releasing resources) execute no matter what happens in the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "Logging is used to track program execution, errors, and debugging information. The `logging` module provides different log levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "The `__del__` method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be deleted, helping with resource cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6. What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?**\n",
        "- `import module_name` imports the whole module.\n",
        "- `from module_name import function_name` imports only a specific function or variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num = int(\"abc\")\n",
        "except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n",
        "    print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## **8. What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "The `with` statement ensures that a file is automatically closed after execution.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
        "    content = f.read()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## **9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "- **Multithreading**: Multiple threads share the same memory space (better for I/O-bound tasks).\n",
        "- **Multiprocessing**: Multiple processes run independently with separate memory (better for CPU-bound tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "## **10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "1. Helps in debugging.\n",
        "2. Stores error history for future analysis.\n",
        "3. Allows monitoring of program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "Python uses automatic memory management, including garbage collection and reference counting, to allocate and free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "1. **Try block**: Executes the code that may cause an error.\n",
        "2. **Except block**: Catches and handles the error.\n",
        "3. **Else block**: Executes if no exception occurs.\n",
        "4. **Finally block**: Executes cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, optimizes resource usage, and improves program performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **14. What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "The `try` block contains code that may raise an error, while the `except` block handles those errors to prevent crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "Python uses **reference counting** and a **cyclic garbage collector** to automatically free unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **16. What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "The `else` block runs only if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "1. **DEBUG** - Detailed information for debugging.\n",
        "2. **INFO** - General runtime events.\n",
        "3. **WARNING** - Potential issues.\n",
        "4. **ERROR** - Errors that prevent execution.\n",
        "5. **CRITICAL** - Serious errors that may crash the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **18. What is the difference between `os.fork()` and `multiprocessing` in Python?**\n",
        "- `os.fork()` creates a child process (Unix/Linux only).\n",
        "- `multiprocessing` module works cross-platform and provides better process management.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "Closing a file releases system resources and prevents data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **20. What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "- `file.read()`: Reads the entire file.\n",
        "- `file.readline()`: Reads only one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **21. What is the `logging` module in Python used for?**\n",
        "The `logging` module is used to record program events, errors, and debug information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **22. What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "The `os` module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as file operations and directory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "1. **High memory usage** due to dynamic typing.\n",
        "2. **Circular references** leading to memory leaks.\n",
        "3. **Garbage collection overhead** slowing performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"This is a custom exception!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## **25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "Multithreading is useful in I/O-bound applications like:\n",
        "- Web scraping\n",
        "- GUI applications\n",
        "- Network operations\n"
